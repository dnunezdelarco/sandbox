                <p>Shrek is one of my favorite movies, and, therefore, I'm creating a website about it.</p>
        
                <p>Shrek is a popular animated film franchise created by DreamWorks Animation, first released in 2001. It follows the story of Shrek, a grumpy and reclusive ogre, who lives in a swamp. His life is disrupted when fairy tale creatures invade his home, leading him on a journey to rescue Princess Fiona with the help of his talkative companion, Donkey. The film is known for its comedic take on classic fairy tales, its heartwarming themes of friendship and self-acceptance, and its witty humor, which appeals to both children and adults.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>There are four Shrek movies. The following is a brief description of each.</p>

                <h3>Shrek</h3>

                    <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/19/arts/18shrek-1/merlin_138629046_18e57da7-1942-489b-bbc9-66fb431c1206-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale" alt="Shrek 1">

                    <p><em>Shrek (2001)</em> follows the journey of a reclusive ogre named Shrek, who lives in a swamp. His quiet life is disrupted when Lord Farquaad, a power-hungry ruler, banishes fairy tale creatures to Shrek's swamp. To get his home back, Shrek strikes a deal with Farquaad: rescue Princess Fiona, who is trapped in a tower guarded by a dragon, so Farquaad can marry her and become king.</p>

                    </p>Shrek embarks on the quest with a talkative and energetic donkey named Donkey. They rescue Fiona, but Shrek and Fiona begin to develop feelings for each other, despite her initial frustration. Along the way, it’s revealed that Fiona has been cursed to turn into an ogre at sunset each day, and she hides this secret.</p>
                        
                    <p>As Shrek overhears Fiona say she could never love an ogre (misinterpreting it), he returns her to Farquaad without expressing his feelings. However, Shrek eventually realizes his mistake and, with Donkey's help, crashes Fiona’s wedding to Farquaad. Fiona’s curse is broken, and she permanently becomes an ogre, revealing her true self. Shrek and Fiona confess their love, get married, and return to the swamp, where they live happily ever after.</p>

                <h3>Shrek 2</h3>
                
                    <img src="https://andrewmoodie.co.uk/content/uploads/2023/08/Shrek-2.jpg" alt="Shrek 2">

                    <p>In <em>Shrek 2 (2004)</em>, Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon and are invited by Fiona’s parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian of Far Far Away, to attend a royal ball celebrating their marriage. Shrek, uncomfortable with meeting Fiona’s royal parents as an ogre, reluctantly agrees to go, accompanied by Donkey.</p>

                    <p>Upon arrival, Fiona’s parents are shocked to see that both Fiona and Shrek are ogres. King Harold, particularly displeased, secretly conspires with the Fairy Godmother, who wants her son, Prince Charming, to marry Fiona. Meanwhile, Shrek feels out of place in Fiona’s royal world and becomes insecure about their relationship.</p>

                    <p>To fix things, Shrek seeks out a “Happily Ever After” potion from the Fairy Godmother’s factory, which promises to turn both Shrek and Fiona into their most beautiful forms. Shrek turns into a handsome human, and Fiona reverts to her original human form. However, the potion’s effects are temporary, and only a true love’s kiss can make the change permanent. While Shrek tries to win Fiona back, Prince Charming, with help from the Fairy Godmother, pretends to be Shrek in his human form and tries to trick Fiona into falling in love with him.</p>

                    <p>With the help of Donkey and Puss in Boots (a swashbuckling cat they meet along the way), Shrek crashes the royal ball. Fiona realizes her true love is Shrek, not Prince Charming. They kiss, and both return to their ogre forms, embracing their love for each other as they are. The movie ends with Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey happily returning to their swamp, content with their lives as they are.</p>

                <h3>Shrek the Third</h3>

                    <img src="https://images.mubicdn.net/images/film/8790/cache-11430-1481132662/image-w1280.jpg?size=800x" alt="Shrek 3">

                    <p><em>Shrek the Third (2007)</em> follows Shrek as he faces new responsibilities when King Harold, Fiona’s father, falls ill. As the king’s dying wish, he names Shrek as the heir to the throne of Far Far Away. Shrek, who is not interested in ruling, sets out on a journey to find the rightful heir, Fiona’s young cousin, Arthur (“Artie”), a timid teenager attending school in a distant land.</p>

                    <p>Shrek is joined by Donkey and Puss in Boots on his quest to bring Artie back. Meanwhile, back in Far Far Away, Prince Charming, seeking revenge for his mother’s defeat, rallies a group of fairy tale villains to seize the throne and take control of the kingdom.</p>

                    <p>During the journey, Shrek struggles with the idea of becoming a father, as Fiona reveals she is pregnant. As they find Artie, Shrek tries to convince him to take the throne, but Artie is insecure and doesn’t believe he’s fit for the role. After some misadventures, Artie begins to gain confidence with Shrek’s guidance.</p>

                    <p>As they return to Far Far Away, they find Prince Charming has taken over the kingdom and captured Fiona and her friends. In the final showdown, Artie uses his newfound confidence to persuade the villains to change their ways, and Shrek stops Prince Charming. In the end, Artie takes the throne as king, and Shrek returns to the swamp with Fiona, ready to start their family.</p>

                    <p>The movie concludes with Shrek embracing fatherhood, as Fiona gives birth to their ogre triplets.</p>

                <h3>Shrek Forever After</h3>
                    
                    <img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/artslife/movies/2010/05/shrek/fiona-kids-shrek_wide-bf077ab8cd81cf7d678e7acf44cc8dadb26d48d3.jpg?s=1400&c=100&f=jpeg" alt="Shrek 4">

                    <p><em>Shrek Forever After (2010)</em>, also known as <em>Shrek: The Final Chapter</em>, follows Shrek as he goes through a midlife crisis. Now living a domesticated life with Fiona and their three children, Shrek longs for the days when he was a fearsome ogre, free from responsibilities. Overwhelmed by the demands of family life, he becomes frustrated and nostalgic for his old life of solitude.</p>

                    <p>During his frustration, Shrek meets Rumpelstiltskin, a trickster who offers him a deal: one day as a real ogre in exchange for one day from Shrek’s past. Shrek signs the contract, unaware that the day Rumpelstiltskin takes is the day Shrek was born. As a result, Shrek is transported to an alternate reality where he was never born, and Far Far Away is a dystopian kingdom ruled by Rumpelstiltskin.</p>

                    <p>In this new world, Shrek is feared again as an ogre, but Fiona, Donkey, and Puss in Boots no longer know him. Fiona is now a warrior leading an ogre resistance, Donkey works for witches, and Puss is an overweight, lazy cat. Shrek learns that the only way to break the contract and return to his old life is to receive “true love’s kiss” from Fiona, but since they’ve never met in this reality, it’s a challenge.</p>

                    <p>Shrek works to win over Fiona’s heart again, helping her in the fight against Rumpelstiltskin. In the end, they share a kiss, breaking the spell and restoring the original timeline. Shrek is returned to his normal life, appreciating his family and friends more than ever, realizing that what he once took for granted was what truly made him happy. The movie ends with Shrek celebrating his family and the life he once longed to escape.</p>

                <h3>Far Far Away</h3>
                    <p>A lavish, Hollywood-inspired kingdom that is the home of Fiona’s parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian. It’s characterized by its luxurious castle, bustling city life, and fairy tale celebrity culture. Many important events, including royal balls and battles, take place here.</p>

                <h3>Worcestershire Academy</h3>
                    <p>The medieval high school attended by Arthur (Artie) Pendragon. Shrek and his friends visit this school in <em>Shrek the Third</em> to bring Artie back as the future king of Far Far Away.</p>

                <h3>Rumpelstiltskin’s Palace</h3>
                    <p>A grand, luxurious palace that Rumpelstiltskin rules over in the alternate reality of <em>Shrek Forever After</em>. It’s where he holds lavish parties and controls the kingdom after tricking Shrek into erasing himself from existence.</p>
