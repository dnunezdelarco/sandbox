            <h2>Summary</h2>

                <p>The following is a brief description of the plot of <em>Zootopia</em>.</p>

                    <p>In Zootopia, the story begins with Judy Hopps, a determined young rabbit who dreams of becoming a police officer despite the challenges of her small size and the doubts of others. After graduating from the Zootopia Police Academy, she is excited to start her new job, but her enthusiasm is quickly dampened when she is assigned to parking duty, far from the action she craves.</p>

                    <p>Eager to prove herself, Judy seizes an opportunity when she learns about a missing mammal case involving several predator animals. To investigate further, she confronts a cunning fox named Nick Wilde, who has a reputation as a con artist. Initially, their partnership is rocky due to their differing backgrounds and prejudices—Judy struggles with her bias against predators, while Nick is skeptical of authority and her intentions.</p>

                    <p>As they delve deeper into the case, Judy and Nick discover a conspiracy involving a mysterious serum that causes predators to regress to their primal instincts. This revelation uncovers underlying tensions in Zootopia, where the peace between predator and prey is fragile. Their investigation leads them through various districts of the city, showcasing the rich diversity of Zootopia—from the bustling Sahara Square to the icy Tundratown.</p>

                    <p>Throughout their journey, Judy and Nick face numerous challenges, including dangerous encounters and the pressures of societal stereotypes. Judy learns the harsh realities of discrimination and the importance of empathy, while Nick confronts his own painful past and the prejudices he has faced as a fox.</p>

                    <p>As they work together, the duo forms a strong bond, helping each other overcome their biases. Their dynamic ultimately proves crucial as they race against time to expose the truth behind the missing animals and the orchestrator of the chaos—an unexpected antagonist who manipulates fear to divide the city.</p>

                    <p>In the end, Judy and Nick successfully solve the case, restoring peace and understanding in Zootopia. Their adventure not only brings them closer as friends but also highlights the film's central themes of acceptance, teamwork, and the fight against stereotypes. Judy earns her place in the police force, and together, they demonstrate that true strength lies in unity and embracing differences.</p>
